                    New day design was founded to enable small organisations, not-for-profits and charities that are enacting positive impact on society to tell their stories. By first focussing on understanding your cause, we are able to create custom websites that tell your story effectively, with distinct considerations made for the site experiences of primary users, donors and funding bodies.

                <div class="our-model__text">
                    We place a heavy focus on regular communication with our clients. In doing so, we create a feedback loop that greatly reduces the number of design iterations required translating into big savings in time and cost as well as website designs that accurately represent you and your cause.

                <div class="our-model__text">
                    Unlike most website design companies, we don't believe in package pricing, but we do believe in budgets. This means if we set a budget with you and finish the site sooner than expected, we will only charge for the hours we spent. If you have a particularly tight budget we can also provide a set of minimum guaranteed requirements to complete in the budget as well as time dependent additional goals.

                <div class="our-model__text">
                    Once we have understood your goals and fully discussed the structure of the site and user experience we will begin to build the core site structure. We use variables for all elements of the site that allow us to make sweeping changes across the site if you change your mind about elements of the aesthetic later on. As your brand develops, this can allow you to easily adapt your sites aesthetic to match, future proofing your site. We fix our hourly rate for a minimum of 1 year from the completion of the site and commit to make all future changes at our hourly rate. This protects you from unexpected minimum charges or costs when you want to make changes or additions in future.

If you are a commercial business and would like to support our work with worthy stories, we also offer packages that directly subsidise work on low budget worthy story projects.                 </div>

                    As well as fully custom sites we offer a low cost artist portfolio package based on our own custom template. The template can be adapted to represent your work and style but is custom coded to be hosted for free on GitHub, meaning no monthly subscription costs - you only need to cover the one off template purchase and your yearly domain cost to GoDaddy or similar.
